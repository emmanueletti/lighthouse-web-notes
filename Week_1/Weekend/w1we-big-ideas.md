### Big Ideas from W1WE

- every file in node is a module
- node attaches a "module.exports" object to all files run with node
- default property in module.exports is an empty object
- we can assign values to the module.exports property
- can assign an object filled with whatever
  - functions
  - objects
  - data
  - primitives
  - whatever
- when we need to access what has been assigned to another modules export property we use nodes require syntax and give it the relative file path
- SUPER USEFUL
