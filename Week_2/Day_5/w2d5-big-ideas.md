### Big Ideas from W2D2 - Object Oriented Programming

- OOP stands on the idea that data(state) is inherently tied to specific behavior(functions) that work on that data
- so why not group them together into packages of key:vlaue pairs (objects)
- OOP is simply an approach to writing coded that is:

  1. broken up into easile re-useable bigh sized chunks (modularity)
     - functional programming alternative:
     - splitting up code into modules and importing what you need into main controller files
  2. DRY
  3. not repeated

- code that is modular, resuseable, and DRY is easy to maintain, test, and expand

- the pillars of OOP are:

1. instantiation
   - the ability to create a "class" blue print and instead of copy and pasting the object, you can create instances of them from the blue prints
2. inheritance
3. polymorphism
